# Yoshimitsu
MultiThreaded version of a custom protocol built on TCP/IP stack. here am implementing a more rather generic protocol to control the messages sent over in this network, apparently the main use case is for a centralized IRC Network. the code flow follows basic server-client implementations, where the server binds and accepts connections from the clients and the clients connects and sends messages to the server and vice versa.

# Modules
- [x] server module : holds the implementation for the server codes
- [x] client module : holds the implementation for the client codes

# Notes
This project is still work in progress
